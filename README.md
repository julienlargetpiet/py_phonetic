# py_phonetic

Set of python programms allowing to traduct any text in the given language to the IPA (International Phonetic Language).

## Development

For now only the following languages are available:

- french

### Audio version

For certain languages, a text to speech feature can be included.

# Classification

- language.py corresponds to the language of the text you want to traduct to the IPA

- language_audio.py corresponds to the text to speech version. So, in addition to traduct the input text of a given language to the IPA, it proceeds a text to speech with the known intonation of the selected language.
